- Web services :
Used to exchange data via oData or Soap URLs over HTTP protocol, Soap envelops the data and works on a fixed contract manner(only with XML) contrary to oData that actually works 
on an open format (XML and json), both oData and SOAP needs to be enabled on the service tier under the corresponding tabs

- API cannot be viewed from the web client straight away nor from the "Web Services" page in BSC 
- "Custom API" refers to a page or querty created with type "API".
-  They can be acessed through postman (basic authentication-user name, web service acess key or Oauth authentication)
- Note that Odata and Soap must be enabled in the service tier firt
- All available API within BSC can be accessible through : http://localhost:1948/BC193/api/v2.0 (mind Odata port that is different from 8080)
- If there are multiple companies within a tenant then the company ID needs to be supplied first through : http://localhost:1948/BC193/api/v2.0/companies
- Once company ID grabed then say an "Items" API can be viewed filtered on the company ID : http://localhost:1948/BC193/api/v2.0/companies(4f1db4ab-7482-ec11-85d4-00155d19383a)/items
- For the cloud acess to available API : postman can be used yet with this url : https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com/v2.0/2b31fe61-4907-4dce-8fa7-e489b983f1e9/Sandbox/api/v2.0
- Tenant ID and env name are available under Help and support => Azure AD tenant and environment name
- Credentials as username and password on postman need to be grabbed from the "Users" page of bsc, "User Name" is the user name on postman and the password
needs to be generated under "Web Service Access Key" (expand the page to grab the value without special characters or spaces)
- Then follow the same pattern to view items or items filtered per company or even the list of available companies
- It is recommended to use "System ID" as a primary key when creating an API, it will be used as primary key in the API definition as a parameter : ODataKeyFields = SystemId
